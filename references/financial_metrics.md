## KPI card direction (Phase 5 placeholders, `zh` / `en`)

The locked HTML template applies **`up` / `down` / `neutral-kpi`** to both the **`.kpi-card`** and the **`.kpi-change`** for each KPI (classes must match; see `agents/report_validator.md`). **Headline KPI values:** use a **leading minus** for negatives (e.g. **-22.3%**, **-$1.2B** / 中文 **-22.3%**、**-16.4亿美元**); **do not prefix Chinese KPI amounts with 「约」**—give rounded digits + unit directly. Do not paraphrase with “净亏损约” / “approx. negative” instead of **`-`** (see `references/report_style_guide_cn.md` / `report_style_guide_en.md`).

**Free cash flow (KPI 3) — avoid misleading green when still negative:**  
If **FCF is negative in both** `current_year` and `prior_year` (from `cash_flow` / `income_statement` era) **but** the current period is **less negative** (improvement toward zero), set **`{{KPI3_DIRECTION}}` = `neutral-kpi`** and write **`{{KPI3_CHANGE}}`** with a **quantified** YoY narrowing (e.g. USD millions converted to the same “亿” convention as the headline value) plus an explicit **“仍未转正 / still negative”** clause. Do **not** use `up` + vague “明显改善 / significant improvement” without numbers — that violates `references/report_style_guide_cn.md` (avoid empty intensifiers) and confuses readers next to loss-making net income cards.

If FCF is **positive** and higher than the prior year, `up` is appropriate. If FCF is **more negative** than the prior year, use `down`.

## Metrics table YoY movement verdict (`{{METRICS_ROWS}}`)

The Section II metrics table's final column is a **reader-facing conclusion label**, not a raw numeric delta. Do **not** fill it with values like `+0.62%`, `-1.4pct`, or `+4.55%`. Those numbers may appear in the metric value columns or narrative, but the last cell must summarize what the comparison means.

For Chinese reports, use this controlled vocabulary unless a filing-specific edge case requires a clearly equivalent short label:

| Label | Use when |
|-------|----------|
| `显著改善` | Materially better YoY: strong margin expansion, large loss-to-profit swing, large FCF improvement, or a ratio moving decisively in the healthy direction. |
| `改善` | Better YoY, but not dramatic. |
| `基本持平` | Change is immaterial or within rounding/noise. |
| `恶化` | Worse YoY, but not severe. |
| `显著恶化` | Materially worse YoY: sharp margin compression, profit-to-loss swing, large FCF deterioration, or leverage/liquidity moving materially against the company. |
| `权益缺口收窄` | Shareholders' equity is still negative, but the deficit narrowed YoY. |
| `权益缺口扩大` | Shareholders' equity is negative and the deficit widened YoY. |
| `期末股东权益为负` | ROE / debt-to-equity / equity-based ratios are not economically meaningful because ending equity is negative. |
| `不适用` | Prior-year denominator is missing, zero, or the metric is not comparable. |

For English reports, use the matching controlled labels: `Significantly improved`, `Improved`, `Stable`, `Deteriorated`, `Significantly deteriorated`, `Equity deficit narrowed`, `Equity deficit widened`, `Ending equity negative`, `N/A`.

Classification guidance:

- For "higher is better" metrics (gross margin, operating margin, net margin, ROE, ROA, EPS, FCF margin, interest coverage), a higher current value is `改善`; a lower current value is `恶化`.
- For "lower is better" risk metrics (asset-liability ratio, debt/equity, net debt/EBITDA, capex intensity if interpreted as cash burden), a lower current value is `改善`; a higher current value is `恶化`.
- If current and prior values are both negative but current is closer to zero, use `改善` or `权益缺口收窄` depending on the metric. Do not write `+x%` in the verdict cell.
- If ending shareholders' equity is negative, do not force ROE or debt/equity into a numeric "improved/worse" verdict; use `期末股东权益为负` or the equity-deficit labels.

Example rows:

```html
<tr><td>毛利率</td><td>46.2%</td><td>45.6%</td><td class="metric-up">改善</td></tr>
<tr><td>ROE</td><td>不适用</td><td>不适用</td><td class="metric-down">期末股东权益为负</td></tr>
<tr><td>每股收益（EPS）</td><td>-0.21美元</td><td>-0.38美元</td><td class="metric-up">改善</td></tr>
```

Validator expectation: `agents/report_validator.md` treats raw numeric-only final-column cells as a pre-delivery warning.

## Trend Classification Logic

For Net Income, Net Margin, and FCF, classify the trend and write the corresponding analysis (2–3 sentences of plain prose only — no Markdown asterisk bold/italic in JSON fields; they paste into HTML as-is):

```
IF current_year > prior_year (improvement):
    trend_label = "↑ Increasing"
    trend_class = "positive"
    Write 2-3 sentences on growth drivers:
      - Volume growth? Price increases? Operating leverage?
      - Segment mix shift?
      - Cost reduction / efficiency gains?

ELSE IF current_year < prior_year (decline):
    trend_label = "↓ Decreasing"
    trend_class = "negative"
    Write 2-3 sentences on risk factors:
      - Revenue decline or margin compression?
      - Rising cost pressures?
      - One-time charges or structural issues?

ELSE:
    trend_label = "→ Stable"
    trend_class = "neutral"
```

## Geographic revenue mix (地区收入结构)

In Phase 2, after computing ratios and trend narratives, write a short **regional revenue** note for Section II’s **fifth** trend-card (**标题：地区收入结构**; English template: **Geographic revenue mix**). The card uses CSS class **`trend-geo`** (green left accent); content must stay **descriptive only**.

- Source **regional / country revenue tables** from the latest annual/quarterly filing (or `financial_data.json` geographic breakdown if Agent 1 populated it). If only product segments exist, say geographic disclosure is limited.
- Cover **amounts, % of total**, YoY or organic growth **by region** when disclosed, and **concentration** (e.g. top region share changing).
- **Scope:** Currency translation, hedging, and broad FX/DXY discussion belong in **Section III** / `macro_factors.json`, not in this card.
- **Tone:** Write **only** substantive facts from disclosures — do **not** paste boilerplate such as “this section does not discuss FX/DXY”; that is an author instruction, not reader-facing copy.

Store the prose in **`financial_analysis.json`** → `geographic_revenue.analysis`. Phase 5 pastes it into `{{GEO_REVENUE_TEXT}}`. Use plain text only (no Markdown bold/italic); HTML does not render `**`.

**Phase 5 — `{{TREND1_DIRECTION}}` … `{{TREND3_DIRECTION}}`:** Map `trends.*.class` to the template’s CSS tokens: `positive` → `up`, `negative` → `down`, `neutral` → `up` (or `down` if the narrative fits). Do **not** emit `negative` or `positive` as the div class — those are not styled. All Section-II trend cards use a **green** left border in the locked template; `up`/`down` are semantic only.

---

## Latest operating update (最新经营更新)

**Section II, fourth trend-card** (between **Free cash flow** and **Geographic revenue mix**). Sources: **`financial_data.json` → `latest_interim`** (if present), latest **10-Q / 半年报 / TTM** line items, earnings release, and **`news_intel.json`** for guidance or one-off items.

**Content rules:**

1. **Marginal, not a duplicate FY YoY:** Describe **momentum** or **inflection** after the latest **full-year** pair used in KPIs — e.g. **YTD** revenue growth vs. prior-year YTD, **last quarter** vs. prior-year quarter, or **TTM** vs. prior TTM.  
2. **YoY vs QoQ (which comparison goes first):** **Lead with YoY (同比)** — same fiscal quarter vs. the same quarter **one year ago**, or **YTD vs. prior-year YTD** — because seasonality usually makes YoY the primary sell-side convention. **QoQ (环比, vs. the immediately prior fiscal quarter)** may be added as a **secondary** clause when the filing, release, or thesis stresses sequential inflection; when you cite QoQ for a single quarter, **name it as sequential** and avoid implying it replaces YoY unless the narrative is explicitly quarter-on-quarter (e.g. exit rate). **Data source:** **`financial_data.json` → `latest_interim`** must be populated by **Agent 1 (`financial_data_collector.md`)** from the latest 10-Q / interim; Phase 2 only interprets those fields.  
3. **Period label (mandatory):** The first sentence must state the **exact coverage** (e.g. “截至 FY2026 第二季度已披露 10-Q（…）” / “YTD through Q2 FY2026 per Form 10-Q filed …”). Readers must not think this card repeats the same FY2025 vs FY2024 annual comparison as the cards above.  
4. **If no interim filing:** Say so explicitly (“最近中期披露不足，以下仍以年报为主”) and keep **`latest_interim`** null or `notes[]` with reason; the card still exists but is short and honest.  
5. **No Markdown** in HTML placeholders.

Store prose in **`financial_analysis.json`** → `latest_operating_update.analysis` and **`class`** (`positive` / `negative` / `neutral`) for **`{{TREND_UPDATE_DIRECTION}}`** mapping (same as other trend cards: `positive`→`up`, etc.).

**Downstream use (optional but recommended):** When interim shows a **material** revenue or margin swing vs. annual run-rate, Phase 2.5 may reflect it in **`prediction_waterfall.json`** → `company_specific_adjustment_pct` / `company_events_detail` and/or **one sentence** in `macro_factor_commentary` **only if** consistent with `macro_factors.json`. The **Sankey forecast tab** remains scaled from **`predicted_revenue_growth_pct`** — ensure narrative in **Section III** and **Sankey note** does not contradict the interim story.

---

## Fiscal year convention (和财报表格「当年/上年」对齐)

- **`income_statement.current_year` / `prior_year` in `financial_data.json`** define the two fiscal years used for Section II, KPIs, and YoY narratives.
- **同比** = `prior_year` → `current_year` as **two consecutive full fiscal years** (e.g. FY2024 → FY2025). It is **not** “skip a year” or “FY2024 vs FY2026.”
- **Calendar anchor (`Y_cal`):** See **`SKILL.md` Step 0C**. When the report folder date is in calendar **2026**, Agent 1 **must** first try **`FY2025` vs `FY2024`** (latest **published** annual normally **`FY(Y_cal − 1)`**). Use **FY2024 vs FY2023** only if **FY2025** annual is **not yet published** — and **`notes[]`** must say so.
- **Sankey:** “Actual” tab = **`current_year`** P&L; “Forecast” tab = **`FY(latest_actual + 1)E`** scaled by model growth, aligned with **`prediction_waterfall.json` → `predicted_fiscal_year_label`**.
- Interim periods (e.g. 9M) require explicit labeling if used; default remains **last two complete fiscal years**.
