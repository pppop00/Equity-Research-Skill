name: equity-research
description: >
  Full-stack equity research report generator built on the Anamnesis Pattern (cross-session institutional memory + scheduled adversarial review). Trigger when the user wants to analyze a company, generate an equity research report, fundamental analysis, or stock investment research. Works with a company name (web search) or uploaded filings (10-K / 10-Q PDFs, HK/A-share reports). P0 mandatory gates (see SKILL.md Step 0A): (1) explicit report language en/zh before any research; (2) when the SEC API path applies, real email or explicit decline before workspace/Phase 1. Non-skippable bracket: P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK reads INCIDENTS.md before any work; Phase 5.7 fires two adversarial attackers (red_team_numeric + red_team_narrative); P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK re-checks every accumulated rule before delivery — flagged blocks delivery. Outputs one interactive HTML report (Sankey, macro waterfall, Porter). Never skip Step 0A — it is the key to all downstream procedures.

  TRIGGER on: "equity research", "research report", "analyze [company]", "financial analysis of [company]", "做研报", "研究报告", "分析[公司]", English/Chinese equivalents, or user uploads a 10-K/10-Q and wants full research (not only a revenue-flow diagram).

# Equity Research Skill

Generate a professional equity research report for any public company. You are the orchestrator — you coordinate data collection, analysis, and report writing, either via parallel subagents (Claude Code) or sequentially (Claude.ai).

This skill implements the **Anamnesis Pattern** (cross-session institutional memory + scheduled adversarial review). See `references/anamnesis_pattern.md` for the methodology; see `INCIDENTS.md` for the accumulated failure rules; see `MEMORY.md` for project invariants.

---

## Boot order — read in this order, every session

1. This file (`SKILL.md`)
2. `MEMORY.md` — project invariants (load-bearing; freeze into the session's system prompt)
3. `INCIDENTS.md` — append-only log of past failure modes (load-bearing; frozen into the same prompt). Read end-to-end. Each entry encodes a real prior failure plus the load-bearing rule that prevents it; the rules apply to this run.
4. `workflow_meta.json` — machine-readable phase + gate contract

Stop after #4. Do not pre-load `agents/*.md` or `references/*.md` — open them lazily when you actually delegate or look up domain knowledge.

---

## Step 0M: Load machine-readable workflow contract (mandatory)

Before Step 0A, load `workflow_meta.json` as the machine-readable contract for this run.

- Treat `workflow_meta.json` as the source of truth for:
  - gate IDs and preconditions
  - phase order (now includes `phase_incident_precheck` first, `phase_5_7_red_team` between 5.5 and 6, and `phase_incident_postcheck` after 6)
  - packaging profiles in Phase 6 (`strict_18_full_qc_secapi`, `strict_17_full_qc_no_secapi`, `strict_13_fast_no_qc_secapi`, `strict_12_fast_no_qc_no_secapi`)
  - `memory_files`: which files must be loaded into the session's system prompt
- `SKILL.md` and `agents/*.md` remain the narrative execution guide; if there is a conflict on artifact presence or packaging strictness, follow `workflow_meta.json`.
- Persist run mode flags early (at least in working notes):  
  `qc_mode = full|fast` and `sec_api_mode = yes|no`  
  so Phase 6 can select the correct packaging profile instead of forcing unavailable artifacts.

---

## P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK — institutional memory, read first

**Runs before Step 0A. Non-skippable. A run that did not pre-check is not deliverable.**

Walk every entry in `INCIDENTS.md` end-to-end. For each `I-NNN`, acknowledge in working state (one short note per entry) before any phase work begins. Currently shipped entries:

- **I-001** — P0 interactive gate bypassed by inventing a default. Applies to Step 0A.1 (language) and Step 0A.2 (SEC email). The only allowed gate `source` values are `user_response`, `explicit_phrase` (§0A.1 only), `skipped` / `declined` (§0A.2 only). Auto-mode is not an override.
- **I-002** — P5 locked HTML template skipped, simplified hand-written report emitted. Every run — public, private fund, hedge fund, family office, government entity, anything — fills the same SHA256-pinned locked skeleton. There is **no** institution-compatible / private-company / scope-limited / simplified bypass. `report_validation.txt` status is `pass | warn | critical` only; `structure_conformance.json -> profile` must be one of the four whitelisted `strict_*` values.

If any incident's `Phase` field matches a phase the run will execute (e.g. private-fund target → I-002 applies to Phase 5 / Phase 6), **raise the bar** on that surface — strict reading of the contract, no shortcuts, additional cross-checks. When the matching phase fires, note that you are operating under the incident's heightened standard.

## Step 0A: Mandatory gates — **language + SEC contact (before workspace & Phase 1)**

### 0A.0 — **P0 硬门禁（不可跳过、不可推断）**

These two gates are **P0**: they are the **key** to every later step. **If they are not satisfied, nothing else in this skill may run.**

| Gate | What must be true before Step 0B / Phase 1 |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| **§0A.1 报告语言** | `report_language` is **`en`** or **`zh`**, resolved **only** as allowed in §0A.1 (explicit table **or** user answer to the language question). |
| **§0A.2 SEC 邮箱** | Either **(a)** §0A.2 **does not apply** (see below), **or (b)** it applies and the user has supplied a **real email** or an **explicit decline** (`no email` / `不提供邮箱` / unmistakable refusal). |

**Strictly forbidden until both rows above are satisfied for this run** (non-exhaustive):

- Creating **`workspace/`**, writing any **`financial_data.json`** / intermediate JSON, or starting **Phase 1–6**
- Spawning or simulating **Agents 1–5**, `web_search` / `web_fetch` for **company financials, filings, or industry research** (other than the **single** listing-resolution search allowed in §0A.2 when the primary listing is unclear — and that search is **only** after §0A.1 is complete)
- Announcing progress such as “正在生成完整研报…”, “Starting Phase 1…”, “collecting 10-K…”, or otherwise behaving as if research has begun
- **Inferring** `report_language` from the user’s conversational language (e.g. Chinese vs English messages), UI locale, or company country — **not allowed** unless a cue appears in the **explicit table** in §0A.1
- **Inferring** `financial_data_sec_api = no` when §0A.2 applies — **not allowed** without the user’s **explicit decline** of the SEC API path (or a valid email for `yes`)

**Do not create `workspace/`** and **do not start Phase 1** (no agents, no JSON generation) until **both** §0A.1 and §0A.2 are satisfied **for this run** as defined in the table above.

---

### 0A.1 Report language

Resolve `report_language` to exactly one of: **`en`** | **`zh`**. This is the **first** gate; resolve it **before** evaluating §0A.2 or performing any allowed `web_search`.

#### When language is already explicit

Treat any of the following as explicit (map and proceed **without** asking):

| Maps to `report_language = en` | Maps to `report_language = zh` |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `English`, `EN`, `英文`, `英语`, `in English`, `English report`, `英文研报`, `generate English` | `Chinese`, `ZH`, `中文`, `简体`, `Chinese report`, `中文研报`, `生成中文` |

**Strict rule:** The user **writing in Chinese** or **English** in chat, or asking for a “report” / “研报” **without** one of the phrases above, is **not** sufficient to set `report_language`. Phrases like “做研报”, “analyze Apple”, “equity research” **alone** do **not** set language — you **must** ask the single question below and **stop**.

If the user states both or contradictory cues, ask one short clarification (still **no** workspace / Phase 1).

#### When language is **not** explicit

Reply **only** with this prompt and **stop** until the user answers:

> **What language should the final HTML report use — English or Chinese (中文)?**  
> Reply with **English** or **Chinese**.

After the user answers, map **English** → `en`, **Chinese** / **中文** → `zh`. If the reply is ambiguous, ask again.

#### Persist `report_language`

- Store `report_language` for all subsequent phases.
- Every agent task prompt (Phase 1+) **must** include:  
  `Report language: en` **or** `Report language: zh`  
  When `en`: **all narrative text in intermediate JSON and the final HTML must be English** (numbers and tickers as usual).  
  When `zh`: use Chinese for narrative as today; final HTML from `report_writer_cn.md`.

---

### 0A.2 US SEC EDGAR API — **real contact email gate (P0; same priority as 0A.1)**

This is the **second** gate. Evaluate it **only after** `report_language` is fixed in §0A.1.

SEC fair-access rules require a **truthful, contactable** identifier in the HTTP `User-Agent` when calling `data.sec.gov` (see `scripts/sec_edgar_fetch.py`). The orchestrator **must not** invent, placeholder, or guess an email.

#### When this sub-step applies

Evaluate **after** §0A.1 is done. **All** must be true:

1. **No uploaded SEC PDFs** for this run as the primary financial input — i.e. **Mode A** (company name / ticker only). If the user attached **10-K / 10-Q** PDFs (**Mode B/C**), set **`financial_data_sec_api = no`** and **skip** the rest of 0A.2 (Agent 1 uses file extraction per `agents/financial_data_collector.md`).
2. The research target is **intended as a US-listed SEC periodic filer** (NYSE / Nasdaq / other US exchange; **10-K / 10-Q** on EDGAR). **Treat as US** when the user says e.g. **美股**, **US listing**, **NASDAQ / NYSE**, gives a **bare US ticker** (`MSFT`), or clearly names a **known US-only** listing context. **Treat as non-US** when the user says e.g. **港股 / A股 / 伦敦**, primary listing is clearly non-US, or the company is private / not an SEC periodic filer.
3. **If listing is unclear**, you may use **at most one** `web_search` whose **sole purpose** is to determine whether the **primary listing** is US SEC — still **no** workspace until 0A.2 is resolved. **Do not** run this search until §0A.1 is complete. If the answer is not US SEC, set **`financial_data_sec_api = no`** and skip the email ask.

#### When 0A.2 does **not** apply

Set **`financial_data_sec_api = no`** and proceed to Step 0B **only if** §0A.1 is already satisfied. (Examples: Mode B/C with PDFs; clearly non-US listing; private company.)

#### When 0A.2 **does** apply — ask for email (or explicit decline)

**Stop** — do **not** run Step 0B yet — until the user either supplies a **real email** or **explicitly declines** the SEC API path.

You **must** send the email prompt (or the `zh` equivalent) to the user in this case. **Do not** skip the question, **do not** assume decline, and **do not** set `financial_data_sec_api = no` without one of the outcomes in the **Resolve replies** table below.

Use wording that matches **`report_language`**:

**If `report_language = en`**, ask (adapt politely):

> To use the **SEC EDGAR API** (`data.sec.gov`) for faster, structured US filings, SEC policy requires a **real contact email** in the request User-Agent.  
> **Please reply with one email address** (we will use it only as `EquityResearchSkill/1.0 (you@domain.com)` for this run).  
> If you **do not want to provide an email**, reply **`no email`** — we will use **web search + primary filing fetches** instead (no SEC API-first script).

**If `report_language = zh`**, ask (adapt politely):

> 若本轮走 **SEC 官方 EDGAR 数据接口**（`data.sec.gov`），按 SEC 要求必须在请求头 User-Agent 中包含**真实、可联系的邮箱**。  
> 请直接回复**一个您本人可收信的邮箱**（仅用于本轮标识字符串，例如 `EquityResearchSkill/1.0 (您@域名)`）。  
> 若**不愿提供邮箱**，请回复 **`不提供邮箱`** 或 **`no email`** — 则本轮财务数据改为 **网络检索 + 源站抓取**，**不**调用 `sec_edgar_fetch.py` 的 API 优先路径。

#### Resolve replies

| Outcome | Set |
|--------|-----|
| User sends a **plausible single email address** | **`financial_data_sec_api = yes`**, **`SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT = EquityResearchSkill/1.0 (email@normalized)`** — strip surrounding spaces; **reject** obvious placeholders (`example.com`, `test@test`, `user@localhost`) by asking once more for a **real** mailbox. |
| User declines: **`no email`**, **`不提供邮箱`**, or unmistakable refusal | **`financial_data_sec_api = no`** |
| Ambiguous | Ask once more; **still no Step 0B** until resolved. |

If the user **already** supplied one plausible email **and** confirmed a US SEC / **美股** context **before** you send the template ask (e.g. same message after language is clear), you may set **`financial_data_sec_api = yes`** **without** repeating the question — still apply the **placeholder rejection** rule.

**Never** fabricate or assume an email. If the user never supplies one and never declines, keep clarifying — same discipline as 0A.1.

#### Persist for Agent 1

- Every Agent 1 task prompt **must** include exactly one line: **`Financial data SEC API: yes`** or **`Financial data SEC API: no`**.
- If **`yes`**, also include: **`SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT: EquityResearchSkill/1.0 (user@domain.com)`** (the same string Agent 1 passes to `scripts/sec_edgar_fetch.py` as **`--user-agent`**).

---

## Step 0B: Parse input & setup workspace

**Input mode:**

- **Mode A** — Company name only → Web Search mode  
- **Mode B** — Company name + 10-K PDF → File-based mode  
- **Mode C** — Company name + 10-K + 10-Q PDF → Full File mode  

**Only after Step 0A is fully satisfied** (§0A.0 P0 table: language resolved **and** §0A.2 either N/A or email/decline resolved), create:

```
workspace/{Company}_{Date}/
```

All intermediate JSON files and the final HTML go here. Treat this path as **relative to the root of this skill pack** (the directory that contains `SKILL.md` and the `workspace/` folder). **Do not** create the workspace inside `~/.claude/` or other unrelated trees.

**Detect environment:**

- Claude Code: parallel subagents as below  
- Claude.ai: same phases sequentially  

---

## Step 0C: Report calendar anchor & latest annual (mandatory)

Use this on **every** run so Section II, Section IV (Sankey), and Phase 2.5 use the **same** fiscal baseline — not an arbitrary lag.

1. **`report_calendar_year` (`Y_cal`)**  
   Derive from the **`{Date}`** in `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/` (use the **four-digit calendar year** of that date, e.g. `Envicool_2026-04-10` → **2026**), unless the user gives an explicit **报告日 / as-of date** — then use that date’s year. This is the skill’s default “today” for **filing availability**.

2. **What “latest annual” must be (Agent 1)**  
   - **US 10-K / many HK & A-share 年报:** As of `Y_cal`, the orchestrator and Agent 1 **must first verify** whether the **complete annual** for fiscal **`FY(Y_cal − 1)`** is already **published** (e.g. in **2026** Q1–Q2, prioritize **FY2025** vs **FY2024** for YoY, not FY2024 vs FY2023).  
   - **Non–December fiscal year ends:** The fiscal **label** comes from the filing (e.g. FY ending Mar 2025). `Y_cal − 1` is only a **default search hint** for December FY names; do **not** force the wrong FY — read the report header.

3. **`financial_data.json` pair (Section II)**  
   - **`income_statement.current_year`** = the **latest complete fiscal year** in the filing set (normally **`FY(Y_cal − 1)`** once that annual is out).  
   - **`prior_year`** = the **immediately preceding** full fiscal year.  
   - **`latest_interim`** (optional but **required to attempt**): most recent **10-Q / 季报 / 半年报** on or before the report date — **Agent 1 alone** structures this from primary filings per `agents/financial_data_collector.md`; downstream agents **summarize or declare a gap**, they do not invent quarterly tables. Use **`null`** only if no filing exists, with **`notes[]`** explanation. Feeds Section II **「最新经营更新」** and may inform **`prediction_waterfall.json`** company-specific lines when material. **Comparison convention:** card prose **leads with YoY** (same quarter prior year or YTD vs prior-year YTD); **QoQ vs prior quarter** only as a labeled secondary beat when material (see `references/financial_metrics.md` — Latest operating update).  
   - **If `FY(Y_cal − 1)` annual is not yet published** on the report date, use the **latest two consecutive full fiscal years that *are* published** (e.g. FY2024 vs FY2023) and add a **`notes[]`** line stating that **`FY(Y_cal − 1)` was unavailable** so readers know why the table lags.

4. **Section IV — Sankey (two tabs)**  
   - **Actual tab (`{{SANKEY_YEAR_ACTUAL}}`, `sankeyActualData`):** Built from the **same** P&L basis as **`current_year`** in `financial_data.json` (the latest **full-year** actual in the file). **Do not** label or scale “actual” two years behind `Y_cal` without the note in §3.  
   - **Forecast tab (`{{SANKEY_YEAR_FORECAST}}`, `sankeyForecastData`):** **P&L structure scaled** to the **next fiscal year** after `current_year` using the model’s predicted revenue growth — label **`FY{current_FY + 1}E`** (e.g. actual FY2025 → **FY2026E**). This is the default “次财年 / 相对最新年报的下一完整财年” forecast, not a jump to **FY2027E** unless the model and narrative **explicitly** target that later year and the HTML label matches `prediction_waterfall.json`.

5. **Phase 2.5 — `prediction_waterfall.json`**  
   - **`predicted_fiscal_year_label`** **must match** the Sankey **forecast** tab (default **`FY(latest_actual + 1)E`**). The waterfall “预测财年” line should use the **same** label.

Pass **`Report calendar year: {Y_cal}`** (and **`Report date: {YYYY-MM-DD}`** if known) into **every** Agent 1 task prompt so searches target the correct 10-K / 年报. When the company is US-listed and the symbol is known, also pass **`Trading symbol:`** and, if available, **`SEC CIK:`** so Agent 1 can run **`scripts/sec_edgar_fetch.py`** without an extra ticker-resolution step.

---

## Step 0D: Primary operating geography — **for macro factor model (mandatory before Agent 2)**

The Phase 2.5 macro table and Section III must use **macro indicators from the region where the company earns most of its revenue** (or the region that drives the investment thesis), not a blind default to US series.

1. **Set `primary_operating_geography`** to one of: **`US`** | **`Greater_China`** | **`Eurozone`** | **`Japan`** | **`UK`** | **`Emerging_Asia_ex_China`** | **`Global_other`** (use only when revenue is genuinely split; see `references/prediction_factors.md`).

2. **How to decide (in order):**  
   - User explicitly states the main market (e.g. “主业在中国”).  
   - **Uploaded filings:** take the **largest** revenue share from geographic / segment disclosure (MD&A).  
   - Else **one quick web search** (or listing context): e.g. HKEX / 沪深 main listing + “revenue by region” / “largest market”.  
   - If still unclear: default **`US`** for a **US-incorporated, US-market-centric** name; for **known China/HK-heavy** names (e.g. major HK-listed CN internet), prefer **`Greater_China`**.

3. **Pass into Agent 2** every time:  
   `Primary operating geography: {value}`  
   Agent 2 loads **the same β row** from `references/prediction_factors.md` but swaps **which country’s series** fill the six factor **slots** (policy rate, GDP, CPI-type inflation, FX, oil, consumer confidence) — see regional mapping in that file. **Display names** in `macro_factors.json` → `factors[].name` (and thus the HTML factor table) must match the chosen geography (e.g. **中国消费者信心** vs **US Consumer Confidence**).

4. **After `financial_data.json` exists** (post–Phase 1): if **geographic revenue** clearly contradicts Step 0D, adjust the **macro narrative and `macro_factors.json` geography fields** in Phase 2 / 2.5 so Section III is consistent with Section II (or add a one-line note explaining HQ vs revenue mix).

---

## Phase 1: Parallel data collection via Agents 1–3

**Inputs:** `company_name`, `report_language`, Step 0A/0C/0D outputs (`financial_data_sec_api`, `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT` when applicable, `Y_cal`, `primary_operating_geography`), uploaded files.

**Agent calls:**

- Agent 1: `agents/financial_data_collector.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/financial_data.json`
- Agent 2: `agents/macro_scanner.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/macro_factors.json`
- Agent 3: `agents/news_researcher.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/news_intel.json`

**Output:** three base JSON files above.

**Gate:** do not leave Phase 1 until Agent 1/2/3 all complete successfully.

**Detailed execution rules, exceptions, and formatting constraints:** `references/phase_execution_rules.md` (Phase 1 section).

---

## Phase 1.5: Agent 4 — Edge Insight Writer

**Inputs:** `financial_data.json`, `news_intel.json`, `report_language`, `company_name`.

**Agent call:** `agents/edge_insight_writer.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/edge_insights.json`.

**Output:** `edge_insights.json`.

**Gate:** must finish before Phase 2; Phase 2 must consume `summary_para_2_draft`.

**Detailed execution rules:** `agents/edge_insight_writer.md` (Downstream Contract section).

---

## Phase 2: Financial analysis (orchestrator, inline)

**Inputs:** `financial_data.json`, `news_intel.json`, `edge_insights.json`, `report_language`, `Y_cal`.

**Execution:** orchestrator computes metrics and narrative per `references/financial_metrics.md` and style guide.

**Output:** `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/financial_analysis.json`.

**Gate:** `financial_analysis.json` must be complete and internally consistent before Phase 2.5.

**Detailed execution rules, exceptions, and format contracts:** `references/phase_execution_rules.md` (Phase 2 section).

---

## Phase 2.5: Revenue prediction (macro factor model)

**Inputs:** `macro_factors.json`, `news_intel.json`, `financial_data.json`, `financial_analysis.json` (if needed for reconciliation), `report_language`, `primary_operating_geography`.

**Execution:** compute macro + company-specific bridge using `references/prediction_factors.md`.

**Output:** `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/prediction_waterfall.json`.

**Gate:** forecast label, geography mapping, and bridge reconciliation must pass before QC (Phase 2.6).

**Detailed execution rules, event-normalization methodology, and table-format constraints:** `references/phase_execution_rules.md` (Phase 2.5 section).

---

## Phase 2.6: Macro adversarial QC

**Inputs:** `macro_factors.json`, `prediction_waterfall.json`, `financial_analysis.json`, `news_intel.json`, context from Step 0D.

**Agent calls:**

- `agents/qc_macro_peer_a.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/qc_macro_peer_a.json`
- `agents/qc_macro_peer_b.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/qc_macro_peer_b.json`

**Output:** two macro QC files.

**Gate:** both peer outputs required before Phase 3.6 merge.

**Detailed execution rules:** `agents/qc_macro_peer_a.md` and `agents/qc_macro_peer_b.md` (each includes Downstream Contract).

---

## Phase 3: Porter Five Forces

**Inputs:** `news_intel.json`, `financial_data.json` (as needed), `report_language`.

**Execution:** produce Porter base analysis using `references/porter_framework.md`.

**P0 scoring orientation:** Porter scores are **threat / pressure scores**, not attractiveness scores: **1 = lowest threat / best / green**, **3 = mixed / amber**, **5 = highest threat / worst / red**. For `rivalry`, intense industry competition or price wars must score high (4-5), while near-monopoly or minimal competition must score low (1-2).

**Output:** `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/porter_analysis.json`.

**Schema (hard contract):** the top level must contain `company_perspective` / `industry_perspective` / `forward_perspective`; each perspective must be a dict with `scores` (5 ints in 1..5) **and** the five force keys `supplier_power` / `buyer_power` / `new_entrants` / `substitutes` / `rivalry`, each a non-empty string. The flat `{scores, narrative}` single-string shape is forbidden — see `INCIDENTS.md` I-004 (writer cannot synthesise five `<li>` from one sentence).

**Gate:** base Porter analysis complete **and** `python tools/research/validate_porter_analysis.py --run-dir <run_dir>` exits 0 before Phase 3.5 QC. The same gate reruns at the Phase 5 entry inside `agents/report_validator.md` §0.3.

**Detailed execution rules:** `references/porter_framework.md`.

---

## Phase 3.5: Porter adversarial QC

**Inputs:** `porter_analysis.json`, `news_intel.json`, `financial_data.json` (for peer A), `report_language`.

**Agent calls:**

- `agents/qc_porter_peer_a.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/qc_porter_peer_a.json`
- `agents/qc_porter_peer_b.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/qc_porter_peer_b.json`

**Output:** two Porter QC files.

**Gate:** both peer outputs required before Phase 3.6.

**Detailed score-change vs maintain semantics:** `agents/qc_porter_peer_a.md` and `agents/qc_porter_peer_b.md` (each includes Downstream Contract).

---

## Phase 3.6: QC resolution merge

**Inputs:** macro QC outputs, Porter QC outputs, `prediction_waterfall.json`, `porter_analysis.json`, and dependent JSON files.

**Agent call:** `agents/qc_resolution_merge.md`.

**Output:**

- `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/qc_audit_trail.json`
- in-place updates where needed to `prediction_waterfall.json`, `porter_analysis.json`, and optionally `financial_analysis.json`

**Gate:** merged outputs become the only authoritative version for Phases 4-6.

**Detailed merge policy and full-run/fast-run exceptions:** `agents/qc_resolution_merge.md` (Execution Policy section).

---

## Phase 4: Sankey data preparation

**Inputs:** `financial_data.json` (`current_year` basis), `prediction_waterfall.json` (`predicted_revenue_growth_pct` and forecast fiscal label), `report_language`.

**Execution:** build actual + forecast Sankey datasets for the locked template.

**Output:** Sankey placeholder payloads consumed in Phase 5.

**Gate:** Sankey year labels and forecast assumptions must reconcile with Phase 2.5 outputs.

**Detailed execution rules:** `references/phase_execution_rules.md` (Phase 4 section).

---

## Phase 5: Report generation (language branch)

**Inputs:** all validated upstream JSON, Sankey payloads, `report_language`, locked template extractor script.

**Agent calls:**

- `agents/report_writer_cn.md` for `zh`
- `agents/report_writer_en.md` for `en`

**Output:**

- `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/{Company}_Research_CN.html` (zh)
- `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/{Company}_Research_EN.html` (en)

**Gate:** only placeholder substitution on extracted locked skeleton; no structural HTML/CSS/JS edits.

**Detailed waterfall contract, placeholder rules, and language-specific formatting constraints:** `references/phase_execution_rules.md` (Phase 5 section), `agents/report_writer_*.md`, and `references/report_style_guide_{cn|en}.md`.

---

## Phase 5.2: Card logo production (when card workflow is enabled)

If this run includes card artifacts (`*.card_slots.json`, `01_cover.png`, etc.), run **logo-production-agent first** before any card rendering:

- **Agent call:** `agents/logo_production_agent.md`
- **Core requirement (P0):** Card1 logo export resolution must be at least **2x** the render slot on both width and height.
- **Required metadata in `*.card_slots.json`:** `logo_render_width_px`, `logo_render_height_px`, `logo_export_width_px`, `logo_export_height_px`, `logo_scale_factor`
- **Fallback when render size not provided:** treat legacy slot as `276x328`, so export must be at least `552x656`.

This phase is optional for report-only runs and mandatory for card-output runs.

## Phase 5.5: Final report data validation

**Inputs:** final HTML + all upstream JSON + `qc_audit_trail.json` when present.

**Agent call:** `agents/final_report_data_validator.md`.

**Output:** `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/final_report_data_validation.json`.

**Gate:** must reach zero CRITICAL before Phase 5.7. The Phase 5 → Phase 5.5 retry cap is **2** (data-validation rewrites).

**Detailed validation expectations and pre-delivery warnings policy:** `agents/final_report_data_validator.md`.

---

## Phase 5.7: Adversarial review (Red Team) — non-skippable in full QC runs

**Inputs:** locked-template HTML, all upstream `*.json` (financial, macro, news, edge, financial_analysis, prediction_waterfall, porter, qc_*), `final_report_data_validation.json`, `INCIDENTS.md`.

**Agents in parallel (concurrency 2):**

- `agents/attackers/red_team_numeric.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/red_team_numeric_phase_5_7.json`
- `agents/attackers/red_team_narrative.md` → `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/red_team_narrative_phase_5_7.json`

Before delegating, write a manifest at `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/meta/red_team/phase_5_7.input.json` with absolute paths to the HTML, every upstream JSON, and `final_report_data_validation.json`.

**Loop rule:** if either attacker reports `summary.critical > 0`, build a single combined revision request from both attackers' challenge lists and loop back to Phase 5 **once** (red-team retry cap = 1, separate from the Phase 5.5 retry cap of 2). A second critical from either attacker after the loop = halt and surface to user. `warn` findings flow into `report_validation.txt` at Phase 6 but do not block.

**Distinct from QC peers.** QC peer agents (`qc_macro_peer_*`, `qc_porter_peer_*`) vote on agreement and feed `qc_resolution_merge.md`. Red-team attackers try to falsify and succeed when they find a real defect. A clean attacker output (zero criticals) is a valid result; do not pressure the attackers to manufacture issues.

**Skip rule:** Phase 5.7 may be skipped only in **intentionally shortened runs** that already skip QC (i.e. `qc_mode = fast`). The skip must be a deliberate, user-acknowledged choice — never the orchestrator's invention. Full-QC runs always fire the red team.

**Detailed attack contracts:** `agents/attackers/red_team_numeric.md` and `agents/attackers/red_team_narrative.md`.

---

## Phase 6: Report validation

**Inputs:** final HTML, all production JSON, `final_report_data_validation.json`, optional `qc_audit_trail.json`.

**Agent call:** `agents/report_validator.md`.

**Output:** final delivery-ready HTML package + `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/report_validation.txt` + `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/structure_conformance.json`.

**Gate:** resolve CRITICAL plus designated pre-delivery WARNING blockers before delivery.

**Detailed blocker policy:** `agents/report_validator.md`.

### Phase 6 packaging profiles (owned by report validator)

`report_validator` must select one packaging profile from `workflow_meta.json` and write the chosen profile into `structure_conformance.json`.

Selection rule:

1. `qc_mode = full` and `sec_api_mode = yes` → `strict_18_full_qc_secapi`
2. `qc_mode = full` and `sec_api_mode = no` → `strict_17_full_qc_no_secapi`
3. `qc_mode = fast` and `sec_api_mode = yes` → `strict_13_fast_no_qc_secapi`
4. `qc_mode = fast` and `sec_api_mode = no` → `strict_12_fast_no_qc_no_secapi`

Notes:

- `qc_mode = fast` is allowed only when the user explicitly requests a shortened run (same policy as Phase 3.6).
- `sec_api_mode = no` is valid for non-US, PDF-first runs, or explicit SEC email decline cases; do not force `sec_edgar_bundle.json` in those runs.
- Cleanup targets remain defined by `workflow_meta.json` + `agents/report_validator.md`.

## P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK — relapse detector, runs before delivery

**Runs after Phase 6 and before announcing delivery. Non-skippable. A flagged result blocks delivery handoff.**

Re-read `INCIDENTS.md` end-to-end. For each entry, confirm the detection signal is green for this run:

- **I-001** — check that `report_language` and `financial_data_sec_api` were resolved with sources in the whitelist (`user_response`, `explicit_phrase`, `skipped`, `declined`). Any other source = `flagged`.
- **I-002** — check that `_locked_<lang>_skeleton.html` was extracted (file exists in workspace), `report_validation.txt` top-line status ∈ `{pass, warn, critical}` (no fabrications), and `structure_conformance.json -> profile` is one of the four whitelisted `strict_*` values. Any deviation = `flagged`.
- (Future incidents — same pattern: each entry's `Detection:` field tells you what to check.)

Write `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/incident_postcheck.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "incidents": [
    {"id": "I-001", "status": "pass", "evidence": "<path or note>"},
    {"id": "I-002", "status": "pass", "evidence": "structure_conformance.json"}
  ],
  "flagged": []
}
```

**Any `flagged` entry blocks delivery.** Do not announce the run as complete. Surface to the user with the exact incident id, the file path that contradicts it, and the rule that was violated. The retry budget is **0** for post-check failures — the run must be re-driven from the upstream phase that failed.

## Final output

Deliver the generated file:

- `{Company}_Research_CN.html` if `zh`  
- `{Company}_Research_EN.html` if `en`  

Summarize: data mode, predicted revenue growth and drivers, data confidence caveats, φ and β reference path, validation CRITICAL/WARNING counts.

---

## Data confidence labels

- `"data_source": "10-K upload"` → high confidence  
- `"data_source": "web search"` → medium; mark estimates with `~`  
- `"data_source": "primary filing (web fetched)"` → high confidence when line items were pulled from EDGAR / company IR / exchange filing site during web mode and cross-checked to the filing itself  
- Missing numbers → `null`, note "Data unavailable" **in the report language**

## Hard floor — non-negotiable rules (composed with `MEMORY.md` and `INCIDENTS.md`)

- **Never skip `P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK`.** Read `INCIDENTS.md` and acknowledge each entry before any phase work. A run that did not pre-check is not deliverable.
- **Never bypass an interactive P0 gate** (Step 0A.1 / 0A.2) by inventing a value or picking a default. The only allowed `source` values are listed in `workflow_meta.json -> gates -> allowed_sources` plus `INCIDENTS.md` I-001. Auto mode does not waive these.
- **Never edit the locked HTML template** during Phase 5. Substitute `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` only. The SHA256 pin in `tests/test_extract_report_template.py` will catch you.
- **Never accept a simplified or hand-written HTML report** regardless of target type. Every run — public, private fund, hedge fund, family office, government entity, anything — fills the same locked skeleton. There is no institution-compatible / private-company / scope-limited bypass. (See `INCIDENTS.md` I-002.)
- **Never invent a packaging profile name.** `structure_conformance.json -> profile` must be one of the four whitelisted in `workflow_meta.json -> packaging_profiles`. Strings like `institution_compat_*`, `private_company_*`, `scope_limited_*` are fabricated and will be flagged at `P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK`.
- **Never invent a status string.** `report_validation.txt`'s top-line status is `pass | warn | critical`, full stop. `pass_with_scope_limitations`, `not_applicable`, `partial_pass`, `pass with scope limitations`, `institution-compatible pass`, `scope-limited pass` are fabricated and will be flagged.
- **Never skip Phase 5.7 RED TEAM in full-QC runs.** The two attackers (`red_team_numeric.md`, `red_team_narrative.md`) are distinct from QC peers — peers vote, attackers try to falsify. A clean attacker output is a valid result; pressuring them to manufacture issues is also a violation.
- **Never skip `P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK`.** A flagged post-check on a known incident means the skill relapsed; do not announce delivery.
- **Never persist a user-supplied SEC EDGAR email** to disk beyond the run's HTTP `User-Agent` header. Strip `(email@domain)` from any `data_source` string before writing.
