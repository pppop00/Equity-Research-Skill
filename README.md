# Equity Research Skill

An **equity research** skill pack for AI assistants such as **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **Cursor**. Give a **company name** and/or upload **financial statement PDFs** (e.g. U.S. **10-K / 10-Q**, Hong Kong or A-share annual / interim reports).

**Report language:** The orchestrator (**`SKILL.md`**) must **ask once** whether the final HTML should be **English** or **Chinese** if the user did not already specify. **Phase 1 must not start** until the user answers. Intermediate JSON and the final report match that language. **English** reports use the same layout as Chinese; output is `{Company}_Research_EN.html` (header: English name + ticker only). Chinese output remains `{Company}_Research_CN.html`.

**US SEC API (optional path):** For **Mode A** (no uploaded PDFs) and a **US-listed SEC filer**, the orchestrator asks for a **real contact email** (SEC policy) before creating `workspace/`; if the user declines, financials use **web search** only — see **`SKILL.md` Step 0A.2**.

The workflow collects data, runs financial and industry analysis, and produces **one interactive HTML research report** with a **Sankey revenue flow**, a **macro-factor waterfall chart**, and a **Porter Five Forces** radar.

**Repository:** [github.com/pppop00/Equity-Research-Skill](https://github.com/pppop00/Equity-Research-Skill)

## What you get

- **Single deliverable:** `{Company}_Research_CN.html` — open locally in a browser; light / dark theme toggle included.
- **Intermediate JSON:** financials, macro, news intel, prediction waterfall, Porter analysis, optional **`qc_audit_trail.json`** after adversarial QC — easy to audit or pipe into other tools.
- **Traceable process:** orchestration in **`SKILL.md`** at repo root; sub-tasks in **`agents/`**; formulas and sector β tables in **`references/`**.

> **Note:** Final deliverable is either `*_Research_CN.html` or `*_Research_EN.html` per user choice. Agent instructions may mix English and Chinese; templates are locked separately in `agents/report_writer_cn.md` and `agents/report_writer_en.md`.

> **Do not** change the HTML/CSS/JS skeleton inside `agents/report_writer_cn.md` or `agents/report_writer_en.md`. Dynamic content is injected **only** via placeholders; see the rules at the top of each file.

**Auditable HTML generation:** To reproduce the locked skeleton without copying another company’s finished report, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_report_template.py --lang cn --sha256 -o workspace/MyCo_2026-04-08/_locked_cn_skeleton.html
# or: --lang en
```

Then replace `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers only. See `SKILL.md` Phase 5.

**Tests (template extract, Chinese + English):**

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

If you change the fenced HTML inside `agents/report_writer_*.md`, update the expected SHA256 hashes in `tests/test_extract_report_template.py`.

## How to use (by product)

### Common steps

1. **Clone** (or download ZIP and extract):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pppop00/Equity-Research-Skill.git
   cd Equity-Research-Skill
   ```
2. Add this repo to your AI session **context** (folder upload, `@` workspace, or open the project locally).
3. Instruct the model to **follow `SKILL.md` strictly** and, in Phase 5, to generate HTML using the **locked template** in **`agents/report_writer_cn.md`** or **`agents/report_writer_en.md`** (match the report language chosen in Phase 1).
4. Provide a **company name** and/or **filing PDFs**. Suggested output folder: `workspace/{Company}_{Date}/`.

### Cursor

- Open the directory containing **`SKILL.md`** as the workspace, or copy this repo into your project.
- Reference the skill in **Rules / Skills** (e.g. “for equity reports, read and execute `SKILL.md`”). You may also copy key points into `.cursor/rules`.
- Example: `@SKILL.md Build a Chinese HTML research report from the 2025 interim PDF I uploaded for company XXX.`

### Claude (web / Claude Code)

- **Claude Code:** Open the repo as a project; run the multi-agent steps described in `SKILL.md`.
- **Claude.ai:** Upload or paste `SKILL.md` plus relevant `agents/` and `references/` as project knowledge, then ask for phases in order (single thread if you do not use sub-agents).

### ChatGPT (web / desktop)

- Use **Advanced Data Analysis** (Code Interpreter) or **file upload**: ZIP `SKILL.md`, `agents/`, and `references/`, or paste the critical sections.
- Be explicit: **run the full `SKILL.md` pipeline**; for the final HTML step, **only** fill the template in `report_writer_cn.md` — do not rewrite the page structure.

## Input modes (from `SKILL.md`)

| Mode | Input | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|
| A | Company name only | More reliance on web research; some numbers are estimates — label confidence clearly. |
| B | Company name + annual-style PDF | Historical periods anchored to the file; forecasts blend macro and company-specific items. |
| C | Company name + multi-period PDFs | Richest factual basis. |

Hong Kong / A-share **interim and annual** reports also work as **file-mode** inputs. Validation targets the **locked HTML** contract.
